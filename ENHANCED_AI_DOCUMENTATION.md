from services.claim_processor import process_claim

# Process with comprehensive analysis
result = process_claim("CLM-2024-0001")
```

### 2. Batch Processing
```python
from services.claim_processor import process_pending_claims

# Process all pending claims with enhanced analysis
results = process_pending_claims()
```

### 3. Direct AI Assessment
```python
from services.claim_processor import get_comprehensive_claim_data
from services.ai_service import assess_comprehensive_risk_with_llm

# Get comprehensive data
data = get_comprehensive_claim_data("CLM-2024-0001")

# Perform enhanced AI assessment
result = assess_comprehensive_risk_with_llm(data)
```
